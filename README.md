### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: The Language Use of Philosophy in History
+ This project is conducted by Jiachen Liu

+ Project summary: Philosophy uses languagy to convert ideas. And their choice of words have changed with the development of history. Ancient schools were clearly using a different set of words in their sentences, and those changes are due to the change of the society.
